# What is this?

A personal project of mine of an HTTP server for backing up photos from mobile devices, and for browsing the uploaded photos.

GitHub project for the Android client is available here -> https://github.com/zak0/photobackup-android

Both this project and the corresponding client project are part of my personal campaign to lessen my dependence on cloud services and move to self-hosted solutions.

**DISCLAIMER:** While I do use this to back up photos and videos from my Android phone, this project is very much in WIP state and should **NOT** be trusted by anyone for their only means of back up of precious photos.

- Compiles into Java bytecode, so it runs on almost anything.
- Generates thumbnails.

# Technical details

- Written in Kotlin.
- HTTP'ing is built with Ktor.
